History of JavaScript 

Interpreted Before 2008 Before Chrome's V8 Engine (Slow)
Compiled (Fast) -> Both after Chrome (Just In Time)

Netscape Navigator:
A web browser which used to dominate the world in 90s with the market share around 90%.
This is where the story of JavaScript starts from.

Static Websites:
Websites used to be static then and browsers could not do even a singal calculation at that time.
In order to do even a simple math browsers had to talk to servers.
Example: Time calculator now and then in browsers.

Making the language of web:
So the founder of Netscape decided to develop a programming language for his Netscape.
Marc Andreessen --> Founder of Netscape

Question> Which was the first browser for public use and who developed it.

Answer: 
First Web Browser Ever
Name: WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus)
Developer: Tim Berners-Lee
Year: 1990
Where: CERN (European research organization)
-> This was the first web browser in history
-> It could view and edit web pages
-> Limitation: It only ran on NeXT computers, so it was not widely accessible to the general public
So technically, this was the first browser, but not mass-public.


First Popular Browser for Public Use
Name: Mosaic
Developers: Marc Andreessen & Eric Bina
Year: 1993
Organization: NCSA (University of Illinois)
-> First browser available on Windows, Mac, and Unix
-> Easy to use, supported images + text together
-> This browser made the World Wide Web popular
Mosaic is considered the first browser for true public use.

| Browser              | Year | Developer                  | Why It Matters                   |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| WorldWideWeb (Nexus) | 1990 | Tim Berners-Lee            | First browser ever               |
| Mosaic               | 1993 | Marc Andreessen, Eric Bina | First widely used public browser |


Making the language of web:
In September 1995 Andreessen hired one guy called Brenden Eich to develop that language.
Brenden Eich -> Creator of JavaScript 

Development of JavaScript:
Brenden starts the development and the rest is history. He developed the whole new language in just 10 freaking days.
And the language was called "Mocha". Then was changed to "LiveScript" and then finally "JavaScript" (JavaScript for marketing purpose because the language Java was popular that time).
Mocha -> LiveScript -> JavaScript 
This is how the language of internet was born "JavaScript".

Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.
