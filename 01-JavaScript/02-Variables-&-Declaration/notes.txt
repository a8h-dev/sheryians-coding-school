# Variables & Declaration

Teach:
-- var, let, const — line-by-line comparison
-- Scope (global, block, functional)
-- Reassignment, redeclaration
-- Temporal Dead Zone
-- Hoisting impact per type

Common Confusion:
-- Why var leaks outside block but let doesn't?
-- Why const allows changing object properties?

Mindset:
-- Think of variables as containers scoped by purpose

Practice: 
-- Guess the output tasks (based on hoisting)
-- Block-level counter using let/const

Usage:
-- Base of all JS, mandatory in functions, loops, API logic
